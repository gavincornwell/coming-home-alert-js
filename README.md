# Welcome

The code in this repository represents a system to alert someone you are leaving a location to come home, for example to alert your wife you're leaving the office at the end of the day.

The alert is triggered by a simple REST API, this could be done manually or automated, for example using GPS features of [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com).
